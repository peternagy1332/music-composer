# Music composing using Recurrent Neural Networks

The model is capable to learn the style of a given artist and continue a previously unseen music in that style.

Since it learns based on WAV files with high dynamic range, the output is quite noisy as well. Nonetheless, if the music were written for e.g. piano, better results could be accomplished.

A more detailed README.md is coming soon...
